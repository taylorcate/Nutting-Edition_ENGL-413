[Transcription begins about halfway down the MS on the left side]
I will now copy those lines which you will find mentioned on
the other side of the paper. It is the conclusion of a poem of which
the beginning is not written. 
Among the authumnal woods, a figure quaint,
Equipped with wallet and with crooked stick
They led me, & I followed in their steps,
Tricked out in proud disguise of beggar's weeds
Put on for the occasion, by advice
And exhortation of my frugal dame. 
Motley accoutrement! of power to smile at thorns, & brakes, & brambles, & in truth
More ragged than needs was. they led me far,
Those guardian spirits, into some dear nook
Unvisited, where not a broken bough
Dropped with its withered leaves, ungracious sign
Of devastation, [possible semicolon] but the hazles [word crossed out] towered
Tall & erect, with milk-white clusters hung, 
A virgin scene! a little while I stood,
Breathing with such suppression of the heart
As joy delights in, & with wise restraint
Coluptuous, fearless of a rival, eyed
The banquet, or beneath the trees I sate
Among the flowers, & with the flowers I played, 
A temper known to those who after long
And fruitless expectation have been blest [??]
With sudden happiness beyond all hope. 
——— Perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves
The violets of five seasons reappear ["re" may have been added later] & fade [crossed out]
And fade, unseen by any human eye, 
When fairy water-breaks do murmur on
For ever, and I saw the sparkling foam & ["&" is crossed out]
And stretched upon the moss I heard the sound [entire line is crossed out]
In that sweet mood when pleasure [??] loves to pay [entire line is crossed out]
[Transcription picks back up on the right side of document near the top, words written down side of right side]
[My guess is that some of the lines were cut off when the MS was digitized]
Of hazles, and the green and mossy bower,
Deformed & sullied, patiently gave up
Their quiet spirit, &, unless I now
Confound my present being with the past, 
Even then, when from the bower I turned away,
Exulting, rich beyon the wealth of kings—
I felt a sense of pain when I beheld 
The silent trees & the intruding sky—
—— Then, dearest Maiden! move along these shades
In gentleness of heart; with gentle hand
Touch, for there is a spirit in the woods.
