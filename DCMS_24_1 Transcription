                Nutting [some text written off to the side]
Ah! what a crash was that! with gentle hand
Touch these fair hazels——— my beloved maid!
Though 'tis a sight invisible to thee,
From such rude [wild ??] intercourse the woods all shrink 
As at the blowing of Astolpho's horn. ———
The spot in [??] we are [??????] joys [entire line is crossed out]
For heart like thine: [crossed out] how mildly does the sun
Shine in between the fading leaves! the air
In the habitual silence of their wood
Is more than silent, and this bed of earth, [ink splotch at the end of this line]
Where shall we find so sweet a writing [waiting ??] place?
Come, let me see thee sink into a dream
Of gentle [crossed out] quiet thoughts! protracted till thine eye [text written down side of page]
Be calm as water when the winds are [something written just above "are"] gone [line may spill over, can't make it out]
And no one can tell whither. See those stems [large X over lines 8-16]
Both stretch'd upon the ground! two brother trees
That in one instant at the touch of spring
Put forth their tender buds, and, through nine years,
In the dark     nights have both together heard
The driving storm———— Well! blessed be the bower
That teach philosophy and good desires [??] [some text written off to side]
[Bottom left corner of page is ripped] [Word cut off] this their still Lyceum, [??] hand of mine
[Words cut off] not this ruin——— I am guiltless here. 
[Words cut off] little worth or sublime [some text written off to side]
[Words cut off] we blazon with the pompous names
[Words cut off] and action, I was early taught [words written in different ink, updside down]
[Words cut off] the lacking of fraternal love
[Words cut off] unassuming things which hold
[Words cut off] station in this beautious world. 
[Beginning of next page]    Ye gentle Stewards of a Poet's time!
Ye Powers! without whose aid the idle man
Would waste fill of the long summer's day,
Ye who by virtue of this dome of leaves
And these cool pathways, make the forenoon walk,
When July suns are blazing, to his verse
Propitious, as a range o'er moonlight cliffs, 
Above the breathing sea— And [something] no less, [crossed out] And ye no less,
Ye too! who with most necessary care
Within the concentration of your groves
Restore the springs of his exhausted frame; 
And ye! whose general ministry it is
To interpose the covert [large ink splotch over this word] of these shades,
Even as a sleep, betwixt the heart of man
And the weary world, 'twixt man himself,
Not seldom, and his own unquiet heart. 
Oh! that I had a music and a voice,
A voice [written above line as if he meant to add it to beginning of line] Harmonious as your own, to tell [something crossed out]
What ye have done for me— [could be a period] It seems a day, 
One of those heavenly says which cannot die,
When through the autumnal woods, a figure quaint
Equipped with wallet and with crooked stick
Ye led me and I followed in your steps,
Tricked out for the occasion, by advice
and exhortaion of my frugal Dame:— [might be capitalized]
Motley accoutrement! of power to smil [cut off —— bottom right corner of page is torn off]
At thorns and brakes and brambles, an [words cut off]
More ragged than need was. They led m [words cut off]
Those guardian spirits! into some dear [words cut off]
