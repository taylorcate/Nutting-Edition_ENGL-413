            Nutting
Ah! what a crash was that! with gentle hand
Touch these fair hazels —  My belov'd Friend[crossed out] Maid!
Though tis a sigh invisible to thee, 
From such rude intercourse the woods all shrink
As at the blowing of Astolpho's horn. — 
Thou, Lucy, art a maiden "inland bred,"[comma inside quotes ??]
And thou hast "known ["] some nurture"; but in truth
If I had met there here with that keen look
Half cruel in its eagerness[; ??] those cheeks
Thus [    ] flushed with a tempestuous bloom,
I might have almost deem'd that I had pass'd
A houseless being in a human shape,
An enemy of nature, hither sent
From regions far beyond the Indian Hills. — 
Come rest on this light bed of purple heath, 
And let me see thee sink into a dream
Of gentle thoughs, protracted till thine eye
Be calm as water when the winds are gone 
And no one can tell whither. See those stems
Both stretch'd along the ground, two brother trees
That in one instant at the touch of spring
Put forth their tender leaves, & through nine years[spills onto next line]
In the dark nights, have both together heard
The driving storm — Well! blessed be the powers
That teach philosophy and good desires
In this their still Lyceum, hand of mine
Wrought not this ruin — I am guiltless here. 
For, seeing little worth or sublime 
In what we blazon with the pompous names
Of power and action, I was early taught 
To look with feelings of fraternal love[squashed writing]
To love[crossed out] Upon those unassuming things which hold
A silent station in this beauteous world. 
[   ] Ye gentle Stewards of a Poet's time!
Ye Powers! without whose aid the idle man
Would waste full half of the long summer's day[. ??]
Ye who, by virtue of this dome of leaves
And its[cramped words or marks above this word] cool umbrage,["pathways" wrtten above] make the forenoon walk[, ??]
When July suns are blazing, to his verse
Propitious, as a range o'er moonlight cliffs
Above the breathing sea — And ye no less[! stray mark?? //In DR's trans but not in manu]
