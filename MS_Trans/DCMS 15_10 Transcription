Ah what a crash was that — with gentle hand   [//Begins on Recto_1 partially down]
Touch those fair hazels; my beloved Maid,
Though tis a sight invisible to thee,
From such rude intercourse the woods all shrink, 
As at the blowing of Astolpho's horn. 
[line is cramped, set just above a line that is crossed out]
Again — [line is crossed out]
[line is crossed out] 
[line is crossed out]
[words crossed out] Yet [something] met thee with those eager [word crossed out] eyes
And cheeks this lovely [word crossed out] with a tempestuous bloom 
[cramped writing] should have thought that I had seen [crossed out]
A houseless wanderer not [word crossed out] a human shape;
An enemy of nature one who comes
From region[s ??] far beyond the Indian hills. 
While in the cave we sate this [      ] morn
Oh[| vertical bar?? "I" ??] what a countenance was thine come here
And rest[??] on this light bed of purple heath
[                   ] and [let me ??] see thine eye
As at that moment rich with happiness
And still as water when the winds are gone
And no man can tell whither 
===========================
An enemy of nature one who comes 
From regions far beyond the Indian hills[, ??]
Come rest on this light bed of purple heath
And let me see thee sink to a dream
Of gentle thoughts[??] [          ] till once again mine eye
Be like the heart of love & happiness
Yet still as water when the winds are gone[. ??]
[obscured writing] And no man can tell whither [— ??]
[                   ] See those two stems   [//Begins on Verso_2 at the top]
Both stretched upon the ground two brother trees
That in one instant at the touch of spring
Put forth their tender leaves and for nine years
In the dark nightsleave both together heard
The driving storm [** ??] I would not[add] strike a flower
As many a man will strike his horse, at least
If[??] from[??] the[??] wantoness in which we play
With things we love[, ??] or from a freak of 
Or from involuntary act of hand][?? there's end punctuation of some sort] 
Or foot unruly with excess of life
It chanced that I urgently used a uft
[                   ] or snapp'd this stem
Of foxglove bending o[']er his native rill
I should be loth to pass along my road
With unreprov'd indifference, I would stop
Self-question'd, asking wherefore that was done
For seeing little worth or sublime
In what we blazon with the pompous names
Of power[crossed out] and action I was early taught
To love those unassuming things, that fill
A silent station in this beauteous world
And dearest maiden thou upon whose lap
I rest my head oh! do not dream that these
Are idle sympathies.
[large page area left unmarked] It seems a day [//Begins midway down on Recto_2]
One of those heavenly days that cannot die
When through the autumnal woods a figure quaint[spills over to next line]
Equipped with wallet and with crooked stick
They led me and I followed in their steps
Trick'd out in proud disguise of beggars weeds[spills over to next line]
Put on for this occasion by advice 
And exhortation of my frugal dame[some sort of end punctuation ??]
Motely accoutrement[! ??] of power to smile
As thorns and brakes and brambles and in truth
More ragged than need was. They led me far
Those guardian [S ??]pirits into some near nook
Unvisited, where not a broken bough
Droop'd with its wither'd leaves ungracious sign
Of devastation but the hazels rose
Tall & erect with milk white clusters hung
A virgin scene! A little while I stood
Breathing with such suppression of the heart
As Joy delights in[, ??] and with wise restraint
Voluptuous, fearful of a rival eyed 
The banquet, or beneath the trees I sate [stray mark ??]
Among the flowers & with the flowers I play'd
A temper known to those who after long[written over other text...continues  ??]
And weary expectation have been blessed[cramped writing ??]
With sudden happiness beyond all hope
— Perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves
The violets of five seasons reapear
And fade unseeen by any human eye
Where faery water-breaks do murmur on 
Forever, and I saw the sparkling foam
And with my cheek upon the mossy[??] stones 
That like a flock of sheep were fleec'd with moss
I heard the murmur & the murmuring sound 
In that sweet mood when plasure loves to pay
Tribute to ease and of its joy secure
The heart luxuriates with indifferent things
Wasting its kindness on stocks & stones
And on the vacant air. Then up I rose 
And dragg'd to earth both branch & bough with crash 
And merciless ravage and the shady nook 
Of hazels and the green & mossy bower
Deform'd and sullied patiently gave up  [//Begins at the top of Recto_3]
Their quiet spirit and unless I now
Confound my present being with the past
Even then when from the bower I turn'd away
Exulting rich beyond the wealth of kings
I felt a sense of pain when I beheld
The silent trees and the intruding sky. 
[       ] Then dearest maid move along these shades[spills onto next line] 
In gentleness of heart with gentle hand
Touch[, ??] for there is a spirit in the woods.  

Then dearest maiden if I have not now
The skill to be thy teacher[add] think [crossed out word] of him
The ragged boy & let his parting look 
Instruct. [crossed out words] Move sweet maid[add] along these shades
In gentleness of heart. — With gentle hand[spills to next line] 
Touch, for there is a spirit in the woods.
