=================================
            Nutting
Ah! what a crash was that! with gentle hand
Touch these fair hazels —  My belov'd Friend[crossed out] Maid!
Though tis a sight invisible to thee, 
From such rude intercourse the woods all shrink
As at the blowing of Astolpho's horn. — 
Thou, Lucy, art a maiden "inland bred,"[comma inside quotes ??]
And thou hast "known ["] some nurture"; but in truth
If I had met there here with that keen look
Half cruel in its eagerness[; ??] those cheeks
Thus [    ] flushed with a tempestuous bloom,
I might have almost deem'd that I had pass'd
A houseless being in a human shape,
An enemy of nature, hither sent
From regions far beyond the Indian Hills. — 
Come rest on this light bed of purple heath, 
And let me see thee sink into a dream
Of gentle thoughs, protracted till thine eye
Be calm as water when the winds are gone 
And no one can tell whither. See those stems
Both stretch'd along the ground, two brother trees
That in one instant at the touch of spring
Put forth their tender leaves, & through nine years[spills onto next line]
In the dark nights, have both together heard
The driving storm — Well! blessed be the powers
That teach philosophy and good desires
In this their still Lyceum, hand of mine
Wrought not this ruin — I am guiltless here. 
lFor, seeing little worth or sublime 
In what we blazon with the pompous names
Of power and action, I was early taught 
To look with feelings of fraternal love[squashed writing]
To love[crossed out] Upon those unassuming things which hold
A silent station in this beauteous world. 
[   ] Ye gentle Stewards of a Poet's time!
Ye Powers! without whose aid the idle man
Would waste full half of the long summer's day[. ??]
Ye who, by virtue of this dome of leaves
And its[cramped words or marks above this word] cool umbrage,["pathways" wrtten above] make the forenoon walk[, ??]
When July suns are blazing, to his verse
Propitious, as a range o'er moonlight cliffs
Above the breathing sea — And ye no less[! stray mark?? //In DR's trans but not in manu]
Ye too, who with most necessary care
As in [crossed out ??] Amid the concentration of your groves
Restore the springs of his exhausted frame,
And ye whose general ministry it is
To interpose the covert of these shades,
Even as a sleep, betwixt the heart of man
And the uneasy world, 'twixt man himself,
Not seldom, and his own unquiet heart, 
Oh! that I had a music and a voice
Harmonious as your own, to tell the world
What you have done for me. It seems a day,
One of those heavenly daya which cannot die,
When through the autumnal woods, a figure quaint,
Equipped with wallat & with crooked stick
Ye led me, & I followed in your steps, 
Tricked out in proud disguise of beggar's weeds,
Put on for the occasion, by advice
And exhortation of my frugal dame.—
Motley accoutrement! of power to smile
At thorns & brakes & brambles, & in truth       60 [inserted later by another hand]
More ragged than need was. They led me far
Those guardian spirits into some dear nook
Unvisited, where not a broken bough
Drooped with its withered leaves, ungracious sign
Of devastation, but the hazles rose
Tall & erect, with milk-white clusters hung,
A virgin scene!— A little while I stood, 
Breathing with such suppression of the heart
As joy delights in; and with wise restraint
Voluptuous, fearless of a rival, eyed
The banquet, or beneath the trees I sate
Among the flowers & with the flowers I played. 
Temper well known to those who after long
And weary expectation, have been blessed
With sudden happiness beyond all hope.—
————  Perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves
The violets of five seasons reappear
And fade, unseen by any human eye,
